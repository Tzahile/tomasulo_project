# TOMASULO

TOMASULO project in Computer Architecture course.

TOMASULO algorithm (named after its creator, Robert Tomasulo) is a computer architecture hardware algorithm for dynamic scheduling of instructions that allows out-of-order execution and enables more efficient use of multiple execution units.

The project includes three parts:
- Assembler: gets an assembly code and compiles it.  
- Machine: gets a machine code and runs it (output and memory are documented).  
- Disassembler: gets a machine code and translates it into assembly code
